# Parallel-Distributed-Computing
Project for "Parallel Distrubted Computing" course (2023-2024) of the Computer Science Degree in University of Naples "Federico II". Implemented by **Francesco Scarfato**.

# Projects
In this repository, there are 3 projects:
* Sum numbers on MIMD architecture with distributed memory ([Doc](https://github.com/fra-scarfato/Parallel-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/sum-numbers-distributed/Documentazione.pdf))
* Sum numbers on MIMD architecture with shared memory
* Matrix - vector product on MIMD architecture with shared memory ([Doc](https://github.com/fra-scarfato/Parallel-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/matrix-vector-shared/Documentazione.pdf))
* Matrix - matrix product on MIMD architecture with distributed memory ([Doc](https://github.com/fra-scarfato/Parallel-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/matrix-matrix-distributed/Documentazione.pdf))

**OpenMPI** is the library used to manage distributed memory, while **OpenMP** is used to manage shared memory.
